A set of .NET libraries for quick creation of visual languages and related tools (spiritual successor of QReal project)

## Usage

As a project under heavy development it has no practical usages yet. Planned features are related to ability of quickly and declaratively specify a visual language and get an editor, code generator
and other tools for it ready to use in any .NET program.

See [API Reference](https://yurii-litvinov.github.io/REAL.NET/reference) page for documentation on what we have so far.

## Build

* To build it from console, run `build.sh` or `build.cmd`
* To build it from Visual Studio, you will need VisualStudio 2017 and extensions: Paket.VisualStudio and NUnit3TestAdapter (they are easily obtainable from inside Visual Studio, Extensions and Updates menu item).
